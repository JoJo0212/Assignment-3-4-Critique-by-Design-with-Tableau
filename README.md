# Assignment 3-4 Critique by Design with Tableau

Assignment 3 & 4 involve the critique of a data visualization using Tableau, sourced from [MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/) 
The task entails selecting a data visualization, thoroughly critiquing its design, and subsequently devising an improved solution. This process includes creating our own visualization, presenting it to a some random audience, gathering feedback on the proposed solution, and iteratively refining it for optimization.

The data I selected is about [Meat Production in Germany](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2023/02/PE23_051_413.html).
